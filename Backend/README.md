# OnlineOrder

This is an application for online-order food. 

I will develop CRUD REST APIs using Spring controllers, apply Spring Data JDBC and repositories to interface with a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS, implement application authentication via Spring Security, and constructed the frontend using ReactJS and Ant Design. In the end, I will deploy it to AWS App Runnter for streamlined scalability and accessibility.
